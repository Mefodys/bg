# bg — Repository Skills Scanner

A Kotlin/Native executable for macOS Apple Silicon. The built binary runs
without Python or a JVM. The implementation uses POSIX APIs; Windows is not
currently supported.

Build with Kotlin/Native (`konanc` on PATH or `KONANC` set to its executable):

```bash
bash build.sh
```

The script also detects the installed macOS ARM64 2.4.20 distribution under
`~/.konan`. Output is the native binary `bg` (also `build/bg.kexe`).

```bash
./bg scan /path/to/repository
./bg scan /path/to/repository --json
./bg --help
./bg --version
```

To invoke `bg` from anywhere, add this project's directory to your `PATH`,
or copy the binary to a directory already on your PATH.

The scanner recursively discovers regular `SKILL.md` files and prints a readable
list grouped by top-level directory, with numbered names, paths, and wrapped
descriptions. Terminal output uses colored section headings, aligned skill names,
one-line description previews, and clickable `SKILL.md` links (in terminals
supporting OSC 8). Redirected output is plain text. Set `NO_COLOR=1` to disable
colors. Use `--json` for machine-readable output or JSON report files.
Each entry has a name,
repository-relative location, description, and manifest path. Metadata comes
from literal `name` and `description` front-matter fields, falling back to the
first H1 and its following paragraph; absent descriptions are `null`.
Descriptions are capped at 240 characters. See [the specification](spec/cli.md)
for exclusions and exit codes.

Run the automated tests after building. Python 3 is used only as the test
harness; tests invoke the compiled native binary as a separate process:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
